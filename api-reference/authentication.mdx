You can authenticate requests with the Datum API using basic auth (with a username and password), token-based, and session cookies. Future releases will include auth methods such as Oauth2.0 and Passkeys.

## Authentication Methods

### Username/Password

Send a valid username and password to the `/login` endpoint. Upon a successful login, the access token and refresh token will be returned in the response cookies. 

Payload: 

```json
{
    "username": "example@datum.net",
    "password": "super#safe$123!"
}
```

Sample Request:


```bash
curl  -v https://datum.net/login -d '{"username":"example@datum.net", "password":"super#safe$123!"}'
```

### Token-based 

With a valid `JWT`, the access token can be sent in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer $DATUM_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Passkeys (coming soon)

### Oauth 2.0 / Social Login (coming soon)
