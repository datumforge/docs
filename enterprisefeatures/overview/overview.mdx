This section covers the features we believe fall into the category of "enterprise ready" - we took a note from Replicated's [enterprise ready](https://www.enterpriseready.io/#features) feature list. While it may be slightly confusing / co-mingled, this section is different from the "Core Platform" feature definitions, even though the naming might be similar. For example, while the system itself may output audit logs which we aggregate and use to provide a platform that delights our customers, this is not the same as a feature a customer could take advantage of and thus is defined separately.
