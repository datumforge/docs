# Product MVP Ideas

- Energy usage, carbon impact reporting of assets
- Carbon impact of the procured assets, which could / should include all the overhead of running those assets (e.g. the data center providers, scope 2, have to provide this)
- System of record to store / manage the information around carbon footprint
- Analytics around change over time to show improvement / decrease, and the marketing companies could use to advertise those things
- Integrate with third parties / providers to ease the burden of removal, destruction, recycling
- Find + display + make available the disposition expense / means of returning the hardware to the manufacturer
- Ability to analyze a hardware platform and make a recommendation about extending the life of the physical asset
- Make it easier to attest that the server was *responsibly* destroyed
