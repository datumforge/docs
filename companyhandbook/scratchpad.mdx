Product Strategy notes to cleanup or delete:

Open source Cloudflare (Network and Security Play) - Let’s ride the eBPF wave and create an open source version of Cloudflare’s valuable bits (e.g. minus the CDN). Use this to focus our team and build out our Enterprise grade cloud, getting a ton of active users, and leveraging our infrastructure background.
Show roadmap that includes Artifact management (Infra / Developer Play) - Make Datum fundamental to how developers touch assets. 
Grab the infratographer community while we are at it.
Introduce Asset management w/ agent (IT and Product Play) - Make Datum fundamental to higher level automation.
Introduce price books and metering
Introduce user, customer, partner, and marketplace management.

[MKA] 

GTM with an open SaaS strategy similar to PostHog, but pursue a public cloud / channel strategy aggressively for distribution to F500. 

Over time go deeper with:

Datacenter logistics - iOS app w/ image recognition & purchase tracker to ingest assets.

Security / Asset Access - group and user management utilities to lower internal bespoke tool creation and ease security and compliance overhead.



[Lots of words have been written about the size of various markets. Good luck taking that to the bank! Currently, it’s all about AI, which is a great example of why Datum needs to exist. The kind of AI that everyone is talking about in 2023 thrives on huge data sets and needs an enormous amount of computing resources and power. This has pointed a spotlight on the idea of specialized software (LLMs) needing specialized hardware (NVIDIA H100’s), but it has also exposed all kinds of weaknesses in most companies. While everyone mentions AI on every earnings call or pitch deck, very few companies are able to innovate and deploy it at scale. We want to fix that!]
