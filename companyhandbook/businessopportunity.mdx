We think there are three big areas where our [foundational building blocks] + [open source business model] + [global secure SaaS] formula can unlock substantial value in a world reorganized around AI, self-service, local regulation, sustainability and other big digital trends:

* Digital Infrastructure
* Modern GTM
* Net Zero / Sustainability

In each of these buckets, our strategy is to identify the lowest level building blocks and to offer developer-empowering solutions in an open core model, centered around a truly “Enterprise ready from the beginning” SaaS experience. A generous free tier is important. Example solutions include infrastructure asset management, artifact distribution, internal chargeback / showback, metering and price books, user data model, and embodied carbon tooling. Stay low!

Where do we start? Datum will focus initially on proving out our thesis by picking off items we need to cobble together to build our own scalable “Enterprise ready” cloud platform: group control, data model, basic scope 3 tracking, etc. In this way our investments mirror the undifferentiated toil that we believe other companies face. As part of this, we find 1+ capabilities to offer on top of our cloud. 

## Monetization

We will monetize via an omnichannel approach that is centered around our cloud service and augmented with roadmap acceleration contracts and support services. While the infrastructure software space is currently a modest financial opportunity in comparison to other parts of the stack, we believe we can achieve $500k in ARR within 12 months using about $1M in invested capital.

As we grow, we will look to monetize only where we can build a community around and help sustain an OSS project; where we can monetize via an cloud-first, omnichannel approach; and where we can disrupt 2-3 legacy solutions with an integrated platform.
