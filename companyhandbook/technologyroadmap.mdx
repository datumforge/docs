- Short / mid-term evaluations and decisions around Federation


Current clip: ~3-6 months
Desired addition: 1 full time, salaried staff (200k/yr)

Core Platform (feeders + scale out):

- Payment Collections and Billing (create Datum's payment collection and billing)
- Subscription / Entitlements as a service (take the core components built for Datum and expose them)
- Form components / pages / white labeling tech (upload / management of branding)
