# High level Roadnmap

<Note>
    Please be sure to check out [current progress](progress.mdx) first to see what ground we've covered to-date!
</Note>

## Engines / Enablers

- OAuth2 Providers (need to develop re-usable core libraries for this)
- External Integrations (Github, Slack, Google)
- Analytics (metrics and logs emission + aggregation - should get consensus on vendors, technology)
- Data Locality / multi-tenant persistence (time box or agree it's not worth it)
- Short / mid-term evaluations and decisions around Federation (e.x. do we envision keeping a "core team" )
- Secrets Management (develop re-usable constructs with existing open source tech or develop our own methods)

## Customer value features / accelerators

- Leverage current stack / capabilities to build out Products and Pricing (create Datum's subscription tiers)
- Leverage current stack / capabilities to build out Quoting and Billing (create Datum's payment collection and billing)
- Leverage current stack / capabilities to build out Subscription / Entitlements as a service (take the core components built for Datum and expose them)
- "Whitelabeling tech" (asset upload, storage, re-skinning, vanity domains, etc.)
