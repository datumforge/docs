## Languages

As a general standard we build using Golang or Rust; this is primiarly a decision driven from these factors:

- All the cool kids do it
- It's the language of choice from the technical co-founder (@matoszz)
- It's the language of choice of the technical co-founder's hipster friends
- There's [science / research](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf) substantiating the efficiency of the programming languages in comparison to others which is inline with Datum's core values

## Middleware

- [ent](https://entgo.io/) for an ORM / database interface
- [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/getting-started/) for graph generation
- [atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) for schema management


## Shared libraries

- Should be the lowest denominator
- Create a repo per package so they can be managed independently vs. a monorepo for all shared packages
- Avoid importing other shared libraries into a library
