To-date, emphasis and development effort have been applied towards foundational constructs such as:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Encryption / Signing
- Key / Token management
- Certificate generation / handling
- Policy constructs
- Hardened defaults

Each section below deteails the specifics of what's been accomplished thus far.

## Build / Release Ecosystem

- Setup of Datum's buildkite organization, fully [public](https://buildkite.com/datum)
- Setup of runners / VM's / agents (plus corresponding setup automation)
- Setup / configuration / public notifications around [detected vulnerabilities](https://buildkite.com/datum/datum/builds/1231)
- Code / test coverage reporting
- Vulnerability scanning and reporting
- Overall ~decent (30%) unit test code coverage
- Authorization / permissions testing
- Artifact signing, publishing
- OpenAPI spec generation and import into docs
- Release changelogs

## API's

- Check out all the available open API specs for [details](https://docs.datum.net/api-reference/user/list-users)!
- Personal org and regular Organization creation with recursive parent / child relationships
- Group creation, membership constructs in-flight
- Organization CRUD
- Group CRUD
- User CRUD
- Personal access token CRUD

Other various API's for registration, email verification, etc.

## Authorizations and Policies

- Initial entitlement-based permissions moodel
- Privacy hook / interceptor implementation + integration with openFGA
- Relationship tuple creation, testing, validation for several objects
- Base policy creation

## Authentication flows

- Username and Password
- Access and Refresh Token Issuance
- Session Token issuance
- Email provider Integration (Sendgrid)
- Email template development / libraries / ability to easily create + send new email templates
- Forgot password / reset password
- Resend verification email

## Security

- Vulnerability scanning, remediation, and [reporting](https://github.com/orgs/datumforge/security/overview?alertTrendsChart%5BisOpenSelected%5D=true&query=archived%3Afalse&startDate=2023-11-30&endDate=2023-12-30)
- SBOM Creation / Signing
- Artifact Provenance (SLSA3) generation + Verification
- Secret Scanning, remediation, reporting
- Change management controls
- Built-in / integrated middleware:
    - Ratelimiting
    - Mime
    - XSS / Clicjacking protection
    - Cache Control
    - CORS
    - Session management
- pgp-key.txt
- security.txt

## Data plane

- Turso performance testing / evaluation
- Database migration creation + linting + visualizations
- Schema versioning and migration versioning
- Transaction integrity and rollbacks
- Cascading soft deletes on related objects
- Expandable interface management (today built / tested towards SQLite but is planned to support additional backends)

## Systems / Company
