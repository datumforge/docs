## Becoming a Culture Brand

Share your stories! The world of business building has its own culture, its own
language, its own lifestyle, and its own heroes and lore. The art of
storytelling is important for every community, from outsized successes and
cautionary tales, to the "Inside Baseball" behind how businesses are built.
This will resonate with the existing community, identify you as a member of the
tribe, implicitly earning more trust. This will also give people who are
interested in your world a better view into it, and possibly a foothold to enter
it more easily. If they _do_ decide to enter your world, they will be strongly
inclined to trust you and do things your way.

### What we wear

What we wear or display can often instantaneously communicate things about
us, and help members of a community identify each other in the wild. A
VANS hoodie, a Salt Life t-shirt, or a Patagonia fleece all communicate
things about the lifestyle or interests of an individual, and manages to
transcend location, employer, industry, language, etc.

### What we share

You read and watch things that catch your attention. You like things that
you support. You share things that are important or interesting to your
community. By creating sharable artifacts, you create things that enables
your ideas and efforts to be the substrate by which the community
communicates, making your presence organic and foundational. When your
ideas and work becomes the standard and basis by which people think about
 doing _their_ work and building _their_ world, the language you use will
 become the language _they_ use, and you will have earned yourself place as
 an integral part of the community.

### Where we congregate

Gathering places, whether physical or virtual, are essential to any
culture or tribe. What will be the local watering hole or water cooler for your tribe? Some communities congregate virtually via tools like Slack, Discord, Twitter, etc., or have in person events periodically, or some have even created cafes, boutique stores for clothing and accessories, or even entertainment events. What makes most sense for your tribe and the culture you want to emphasize?

### What we celebrate

What we celebrate is a strong indicator of what our values are, and what
is considered progress towards the mission and vision of the organization. Celebrating the achievements and stories of the members of your tribe is essential to reinforcing the idea that Datum is an organization that is excited about the world that its community is building.
