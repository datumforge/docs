This section of the wiki is intended for documentation / thoughts / ramblings of Datum's technical co-founder, Matt Anderson [@matoszz](https://github.com/matoszz).

Have you ever ground-up developed an "enterprise ready", production-ready applicatino? Well, me neither. I'm quite good at coming into a company someone else has already built and telling them how wrong all their shit is, but personally built-up a system from scratch? Nah. I've always had the luxury of the pain of the person before me. Don't get me wrong... while this is a daunting task, it's actually been a ridiculously huge opportunity in the form of the things I've had to learn to be able to build this type of application.

Over the course of my career I've developed habits around writing things down - almost always before I even start attempting to write code I do research, read blogs / articles, troll for existing code or prior art, maybe even ask around to people I know who have done it before. This habit is largely a result of having worked for very large "Enterprises" most of my career where you couldn't really get away with changing anything meaningful unless you had this kind of paper trail... or, you could be good at politics but I've only been good at getting angry at politics, so I've been in the habit of creating really detailed documentation / technical designs.

No one may ever read this, and you'll be the judge of the quality of the information published here, but the content I plan to publish in this section of the wiki are largely documents I've written for myself than I had never intended to share, until recently. Thinking about the mission of this company it occured to me I probably don't do enough to contribute back documentation, knowledge, "experience from the trenches", so that's what I hope to do here. Some of these may feel very "bloggy" and that's because they are - Marketing people have usually unrealistic expectations about an engineer's ability to produce relevant blog content so some of the things I write are actually written specifically in the voice / language / tone / approach of what you'd publish in a blog, so that when some silly marketing person comes knocking, I've got already-mostly-done content.
