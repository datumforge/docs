# Overview

The system of acquisition deals with the lifecycle of procuring an asset, financing the procurement of that asset, and the subsequent logistics surrounding getting the procured asset to it's final destination

# Product MVP Ideas

- Barcode / rack scanning for data center operators that does lookups on the machine(s)
- Standard deprecation / financial modeling surrounding procurement and ownership of physical assets
- Vendor / manufacturer integrations for ease of buying experience, tracking, and asset lifecycle
- "Pizza tracker" for procured assets to show more simply what's been bought, where it is physically as it's being shipped, and the status of the setup once the asset has been received
- Create / partner with logistics parties to provide Sstandard shipping boxes, sizes, rates, pickup/drop off from major hubs that fit the standard sizes of most physical assets that are moved in between data centers
- More holisitic financial reporting including setup / install, onsite hands, network, power, standard cost of maintenance, disposition fees, etc., to show a clearer TOC of physical assets
- Integration into chargeback systems (or create the chargeback system itself) so that procured physical assets can have their ownership and use tracked within businesses
