There are currently no guidelines for reporting Scope 3 emissions as part of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, which
cloud provider usage would fall under. However, we hope more and more organizations report on both location-based and
market-based emissions from cloud usage. To that end, our applicationâ€™s focus is on providing a location-based cloud
emissions estimate, and we welcome contributions that could aid with market-based reporting to include energy attributes
such as RECs or power purchasing agreements.

THe application is intended to pull usage data (compute, storage, networking, etc.) from major cloud providers and calculates
estimated energy (Watt-Hours) and greenhouse gas emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (metric tons CO2e). We
display these visualizations in a dashboard for developers, sustainability leaders and other stakeholders in an
organization to view and take action. Our intended scope / focus will be to support AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.
