Demand for data center services is poised to rise, driven in part by emerging digital technologies such as blockchain (particularly proof-of-work) and machine learning. For example, Bitcoin – the most prominent example of proof-of-work blockchain and most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalisation – consumed an estimated 110 TWh in 2022, 20-times more than in 2016. Ethereum, second behind Bitcoin in terms of market capitalisation and energy use, consumed around 18 TWh over the first three quarters of 2022. In September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, which is expected to slash energy use by 99.95%. As blockchain applications become more widespread, understanding and managing their energy use implications may become increasingly important for energy analysts and policy makers.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is another area of demand growth, with potentially significant implications for data centre energy use in upcoming years. While the [amount of computing power](https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute) needed to train the largest ML models is growing rapidly, it is unclear how quickly overall ML-related energy use in data centers is increasing.  

[Early studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243) focused on the energy and carbon emissions associated with training large ML models, but recent data from Meta and Google indicate that the training phase only accounts for around 20–40% of overall ML-related energy use, with 60–70% for inference (the application or use of AI models) and up to 10% for model development (experimentation). Google estimates that ML accounted for 10-15% of its total energy use in 2019-2021, growing at a rate comparable with overall energy growth (+20-25% per year over the same period). 

The combination of rapidly growing size of models and computing demand are likely to outpace strong energy efficiency improvements, resulting in a net growth in total AI-related energy use in the coming years. Although AI itself can help reduce energy use in data centers, the rapid and mainstream adoption of AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Bard are likely to accelerate growth in energy demand for AI.

We believe that additional focus and innovation are required in this space to make the expansion of technology and data centers sustainable long term.
