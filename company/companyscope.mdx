# Overview

We are in the business of helping companies manage infrastructure; some of my resources are physical, some are virtual / SaaS / cloud services.

Our target customer(s) are businesses which are needing to buy infrastructure, for whatever reason.

Description of businesses that fit our target customer:

- Where technology is critical to the business model (vs. nice to have, efficency gain)
- They use infrastructure they touch / control / manage
- They spend more than X dollars on infrastructure
- They are in the business of making or managing software
- They have teams who are competent enough to run / manage the software Datum would make
- They know what open source software is, they are generally comfortable consuming it

# Out of scope

What we are NOT going to do:

- Run customers applications for them
- Own assets on behalf of customers
- Run or configure customer's network
- Build perpetually licensed software
- Provide support / consultation on the practical application of our software, outside of purchased subscription services
- Provide services for installation
- Make hardware, or compose hardware platforms
- Be responsible for compatability of the customer's assets and their application / runtime
