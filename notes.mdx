# High Level Unsolved Problems

- Server / Device discovery and creation of associated logical records
- Server lookup / scanning / information being provided and mine the information
- Rack diagrams, modeling, tracking, image-based intelligence / workflow checker + validation
- Some form of "integrity" checker
- updates to the record, or to the server, when one or the other changes
- Configuration management of the asset
- Ongoing data collection / aggregation of the behavior (e.g. usage) of the asset
    - Getting logs out of the machine and to somewhere else
    - Getting metrics about the machine itself
- Tying procurement / finance to the received asset
- Understanding / availability / setup of some "standard" and generally needed tools:
    - VPN?
    - NAT
    - Firewalls
- Tying network to the server
    - How do you get / assign an IP address?
    - How is that IP routed to the server?
- How does one "back up" a bare metal server and/or the information stored on it
- Artifacts management and mirrors; operating systems, firmware, etc.

# TO DO:

- Read Inflation Reduction Act, and determine what financial incentives there are for our customers and sell them the report and/or see if we could file it for them
- Investigate what % of assets are returned to manufacturers (e.g. how many Dell servers are actually returned to them)
- Look into what ODM / OEM programs exist for return of the assets
- Investigate whats available for recycling
