# Overview

The System of Engagement surrounds most of the interface one would do with an asset - configuring the asset, reporting surrounding the state / attributes of the asset, and the subsequent evidence / attestations around the asset which could be required for security and/or compliance reasons.

# Product MVP Ideas

NOTE: This is the area we currently believe we will invest the least in for an MVP product

- Provide artifacts, mirrors, standard setups
- Provide artifacts within a closer physical proximity
- Provide verification, signing, license, compliance, updates of the artifacts
- Standard shipping, moving, logistics around moving assets around so that we're either extending the life or providing a low cost option of move, repair, destory
- Charge back models and analytics of usage which tie into the system of acquisition
