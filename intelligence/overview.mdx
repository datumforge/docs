# Overview

The System of Intelligence deals with aggregation of data about assets, analytics on the aggregated / collected data, and valuable intelligence, recommendations, alerting, etc., around it.

# Product MVP Ideas

- Comparisom of running versions and available versions from the data collected on the asset
- Analytics and optimization of the assets we have information about (e.g. 10% of your servers don't have the secure module turned on; you could update 50% of your fleet to run in low power mode, etc.)
- Standarized output of compliance related settings and data (e.g. X amount of servers are running this version, and could be updated to this other version)
- "Fleet wide" auditing and reporting - regular compliance reporting and notifications of expections
- Advisories / notifications of things which are out of support windows
- Ability to add additional IT systems / SaaS systems into the reporting to be as cohesive as possible in the reporting / presentation
- Provide available updates (and notifications on the updates) which could be applied to the server
- Provide possible optimizations based on the hardware platform / OS
- Provide remote execution environment(s) capable of remotely controlling the server
- Provide possible changes within the OS and/or hardware platform which could provide security, compliance
