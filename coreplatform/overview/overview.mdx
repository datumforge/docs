<Note>
Each of Datum's development focus areas are grouped based on the sequencening approach; you'll see on the left we've categorized this as "Now, Next, After, and Some day"
</Note>

The founders of Datum wanted to go to market with a more mature product than what most startups would strive for - we wanted our initial product to be "enterprise ready" right out of the gate. You might be thinking to yourself, that's a really dumb phrase and what does that even mean? Well, I couldn't agree more, so let's categorize what that phrase actually means in the form of tangible product features and functionality.

The below section covers the features we believe fall into the category of "enterprise ready" - we took a note from Replicated's [enterprise ready](https://www.enterpriseready.io/#features) feature list. There are a few features which may need partial clarifications while you're reading, because even though the system itself may output audit logs which we aggregate and use to provide a platform that delights our customers, this is not the same as a feature a customer could take advantage of and thus may be defined separately. The features listed below are intended to be direct customer-facing, consunable and/or visible features of our initial platform.
