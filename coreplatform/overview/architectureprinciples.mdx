## Services should be replacable

To keep the bar of entry into using Datum low, we provide the ability to pick and choose the components that you run, as well as the ability to replace services we offer with existing tooling that you have today. For example, Datum will have an IP Address Management (IPAM) service in it's ecosystem, but we recognize that Netbox is a commonly used tool to manage IP addresses. If you want to use Netbox instead of the Datum IPAM service, you should be able to do so by building a thin shim service that translates the expected IPAM API to Netbox's API.

## Communication between services should be avoided

To support our principal of services being replaceable, we want to limit the interactions between services directly. In traditional infrastructure data, there is often tight coupling of data between object types, such as an IP address being shared by servers, switches, routers, and load balancers. While it may be tempting to make an API call in the server API service to get a server's IP address information to return alongside the server information, this tight coupling can cause issues in a world where components are replaceable or may not exist. Instead, we aim to limit communication between services and rely on events to signal changes to other services. Additionally, we use a federated GraphQL API to provide data from multiple services in a single request, further reducing the need for direct communication between services.

## Everything should be Extensibile

To meet the diverse needs of infrastructure deployment, we provide APIs that allow for easy extension of the data managed by Datum. We know that everyone has their own opinions on how infrastructure should be deployed and that requirements for infrastructure may differ depending on the use case. By providing APIs for easy extension, users can customize their infrastructure to meet their specific needs.

## Events, events, and more events

To keep services as small and composable as possible, we aim to follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. When an action is taken against a resource, an event representing that action should be created. For example, when an asset is created in our future Asset API, an asset creation event will be sent to the message queue, signaling that the instance was created. From there, any downstream services that may care about an instance being created can see this and perform any necessary actions.

## Plugin-oriented architecture

Datum focuses on building a base set of providers and allows the experts and owners of additional systems to create and maintain their own providers. By doing so, Datum can remain focused on providing core functionality without dedicating significant resources to maintaining providers for all the different resources available.
