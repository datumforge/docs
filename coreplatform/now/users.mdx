While not considered a foundation of the system, users are a unique resource that exist outside of the tenant structure in Datum. It is worth highlighting this fact to emphasize their uniqueness in the system.

When a user makes their first successfully authenticated request, a new user resource is created which provices a unique ID to represent the user throughtout Datum.

After being created, a user can be granted access to a tenant, which allows them to perform operations and access resources within that tenant and all its sub-tenants. Users can be granted access to one or more tenants, as needed, and can be managed through the permissions APIs provided by Datum.
