An identity is a collection of verifiable claims one makes about oneself. In the context of the Datum ecosystem, identity primarily focuses on validating the claims a subject makes about their identity, where a subject is a human user, a machine, or any other entity that can be uniquely identified.

## Principles of Identity

### There is only one source of truth 

When the system is configured to rely on an external identity provider, Datum makes no assertions about what a subject is beyond their ability to present valid tokens to services and the format of those tokens. Identity management functionality - such as profile updates, password resets, and so on - won't function as this would be the task for the external identity provider.

If using Datum as the identity provider + management plane (preferred), all aspects of the User can be modified assuming permissions to do so are granted through the admin console. 

#### Rationale

Organizations often have their own identity management lifecycles and leverage external solutions for managing their users, service accounts, and other identifiable subjects. This approach requires reconciliation of state between upstream identity providers and Datum services, and the upstream is assumed to be the source of truth.

If using Datum as the identity provider, modification of the user attribute from an upstream integration will be configured within the integration and only certain metadata on objects can be modified by the upstream provider.

#### Implications

Requires an external identity management solution, and to prevent "drift" or conflicts, certain data on the User objects will not be modifible as it's assumed the source of truth of the record lives outside the system itself.

### Identity can be conveyed through JWTs and well-formed URNs

As an alternative to identity management, services authenticate subjects using JWTs from a known issuer as security tokens. Subject identifiers are conveyed using URNs in the `datum` namespace in JWT claims.

#### Rationale

Open standards allow for more composability of components within the Datum ecosystem. An administrator deploying Datum can choose to leverage the default suite of services for authentication or bring their own, provided they issue well-formed JWT access tokens.

#### Implications

JWTs issued to services must conform to existing specifications for Datum access tokens. These tokens must also contain sufficient information to make authorization decisions about subjects attempting to perform actions. Tokens should also be short-lived to prevent replay attacks.

### Identities are bound to issuers

A subject's identity provider is considered to be part of their identity. For example, if a user has the email address `foo@example.com` and is registered with two OIDC providers `https://auth.example.com` and `https://internal.example.com`, they should present with two separate identities with unique subject URNs depending on the method of authentication used.

#### Rationale

When presented with two valid tokens from different identity providers, many services rely on best-effort attempts to understand when those two identities correspond to the same subject (e.g., merging subject records based on email address). This process is inherently risky and makes it difficult to implement features such as authorization policies based on the subject's originating identity provider. Rather than try to guess when one subject is the same as another, it is easier to instead consider subjects as unique based on the combination of their identity provider and internal subject ID.

#### Implications

Authorization is granted to subjects on the basis of the identity provider they authenticate against in addition to their subject identifier. There is no relationship between a subject from one identity provider and a subject from another, even if they share all of the same profile information and identifying credentials.

### All services trust a single source of identities

Within a given Datum deployment, all services must trust the same issuer for access tokens they consume.

#### Rationale

Trusting a single issuer ensures that subjects have a single, stable identifier when accessing services. Additionally, configuring services to accept access tokens from multiple issuers increases the complexity of a given deployment without a marked improvement in security or reliability.

#### Implications

In cases where tokens from multiple issuers must be accepted, methods based on open standards such as OAuth 2.0 token exchange should be used instead.
