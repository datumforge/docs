Locations in Datum are used as a representation of an environment in which resources can be deployed. They differ from physical facilities or other concrete places and serve as a way to represent regions, availability zones, and other logical location based groupings of resources.

Resources created within Datum are associated with a single location to indicate where they should be provisioned. For example, if you have data centers in New York, Los Angeles, São Paulo, London, Paris, and Hong Kong, you might have a "Global" location that includes all of the data centers, as well as locations called "North America Region", "South America Region", "Europe Region", and "Asia Region". You could also have locations that represent availability zones within a data center, such as "São Paulo - Zone 1" and "São Paulo - Zone 2".

Locations are not stored in Datum as a tree, even though the user's implementation will likely resemble a tree. This is because storing them as a tree would imply that there is a relationship between them for sharing resources, which might not always be the case. For example, provisioning a load balancer in the "Global" location doesn't necessarily mean it's available in the locations under it. It simply means it runs in what you call your "Global" region, which may or may not includes all of the data centers you have.

It's important to note that creating a resource in a specific location does not mean it is available in sub-locations. For example, if the "Global" location includes all data centers, creating a VM in New York does not automatically make it available in the "Global" location. Instead, you would need to create the VM in the "Global" location or in a location that is a direct child of the "Global" location.
