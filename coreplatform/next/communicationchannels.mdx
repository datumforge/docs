In today’s world of products, notifications play a crucial role in engaging users. They connect users with products even when they are not actively using them, and they guide users towards tasks they can take action on when they return.

Notifications serve a dual purpose – they are the way we interact with products and the method that keeps users connected.

## **Product vs. Promotional Notifications**

**Product Notifications**

- Triggered by subscriber events within your product or time-sensitive queries.
- Notify one or many subscribers.
- Typically transactional, such as order updates, password resets, or account verifications.
- Can also be used to provide product updates, such as new features or bug fixes.

**Promotional Notifications**

- Disseminated to specific user segments or prospects.
- Centered on promoting products, services, or events.
- Can be used to generate leads, increase sales, or drive engagement.

**Key Differences**

- Product notifications are triggered by user activity, while promotional notifications are sent at the discretion of the marketer.
- Product notifications are typically more transactional in nature, while promotional notifications are more marketing-oriented.
- Product notifications are often sent to all subscribers, while promotional notifications can be targeted to specific audiences.

## Integration Approach

Instead of boiling the ocean and re-creating open source components which already exist, we currently plan on using and integrating [Novu](https://novu.co/) into Datum's stack as a part of the consolidated interface a user would leverage for in-app notifications and notification channels.
