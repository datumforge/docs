## Clone the docs repository

The easiest method of modifying the documentation is to have a local copy of the repo, which you can get by running the below command, or whatever your personal preference is for getting the repository on your computer.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:datumforge/docs.git
```

## Setup Mintlify

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher). Check out nvm if you need a version manager for node
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to where the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`. 

## Directory Structure

<Info>
  Be sure to check out Mintlify's documentation around the site navigation, [here](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/navigation)
</Info>


The directory structure is laid out to match the horizontal nav bar of the published mintlify site; you'll see at docs.datum.net the horizontal nav has "Overview, Digital Infrastructure, GTM..." and compare that to the named directories inside of this repository.

The files in each of the respective directories are the vertical navigation(s), such that each individual file can contain grouped sections and sub sections (and accordian groups), which you can read about in mintlify's documentation [here](https://mintlify.com/docs/content/page)

## Code Formatting

We suggest using appropriate extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If youâ€™re a VSCode user, consider using the MDX VSCode extension for syntax highlighting, and Prettier for code formatting.
