sidebarTitle: 'Our Mission'
description: "We’re on a mission to build a better, more sustainable world by providing digital leaders with open source solutions which help them innovate faster and remove massive toil. We believe that in order to change the world for good, we’ll benefit from having thousands of companies working at scale, not just a handful. We generate value by lowering the barrier to entry at the lowest layers of infrastructure, platforms, GTM and sustainability.

To make our vision a reality, we combine hunger, passion and grit with creativity, curiosity and a deep commitment to open collaboration. We look for humble people who can’t help but to act like owners, who believe being open is better, and who want to do the right thing."
